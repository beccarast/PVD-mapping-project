This is achieved when a family or individual has economic and transportation means, as well as time and personal safety, and a food provider that serves them, whether as retail, wholesale, community grown, or through a trade economy.

In our research, we studied several programs and initiatives across the city that are making the Providence foodshed more equitable. We worked with the John Hope Settlement House to create a garden curriculum for young children; we measured sugar-sweetened beverage availability in Providence and proposals to tax these drinks in the state; we studied job training programs in the foodservice industry. Some of these actions have attained outcomes; others require further research and practice.

          <p class="body-text justify-text" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;">What does it mean to map a food system? And is there a landscape of food justice? Moreover, how can Providence citizens foster a more ecologically, socially, and economically resilient food system, in the face of societal trends that encourage homogenization over diversity; industrialization over environmental health; and concentrated profits over equity?  In 2010, the incipient Providence Food Justice Project set out to explore these questions   Born out of a course-based research project in the Brown University class “Sustenance and Sustainability,” our aim was initially to learn as much as we could about the way Providence, Rhode Island grows, processes, distributes, and consumes food.<br><br>As the project has evolved over 3 years to involve nearly 300 student researchers, our aims remain decidedly pedagogical and exploratory.   Our investigations have taken us from farms to restaurant kitchens, from the gardens of new immigrants to farmer’s markets, and from the offices of policymakers to food pantries.  We have explored the challenges faced by workers and jobs in the food chain, assessed Rhode Island’s agro-ecological landscapes, examined the availability of sweetened beverage prevalence near Providence public schools, and listened to the diverse stories of Providence citizens growing their own food.   We have planted gardens with pre-school children and listened to challenges faced by refugees seeking land access. <br><br>Along the way, we have become more curious about exploring the opportunities and barriers to food justice in the Providence agri-foodscape, interrogating traditional ideas of food access, equity, diversity, health and agricultural sustainability.  Our notion of mapping has also expanded to encompass not only the circumscription of biophysical spaces but also a process of collaborative social change.  We have learned through this process that the way we look at something affects our interaction with it and is an inherently political act.  We aim with this interactive portal to visualize the opportunities and barriers to food justice.  In the spirit of collaboration, we invite you to imagine what food justice might look like in Providence and help us foster transformative solutions.</p>
